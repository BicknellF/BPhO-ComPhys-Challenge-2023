# British Physics Olympiad Computational Challenge 2023

## Challenge #1: 
Replicate this Kepler III correlation in Excel or Python or MATLAB

## Challenge #2: 
Plot elliptical orbits of the planets using Excel, Python, MATLAB etc...

## Challenge #3: 
Create a 2D animation of the solar system orbits

## Challenge #4: 
Create a 3D animation of the solar system orbits

## Challenge #5: 
Calculate orbit angle vs time for an eccentric orbit (e.g. pluto) and compare to a circular version with the same period.

## Challenge #6: 
Solar system spirograph! Choose a pair of planets and determine their orbits vs time. At time intervals of Dt, draw a line between the planets and plot this line. Keep going for N orbits of the outermost planet.

## Challenge #7: 
Use your orbital models to plot the orbits of the other bodies in the solar system, with a chosen object (e.g. Earth) at a fixed position at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. i.e. choose a coordinate system where your chosen object is at (0,0,0).
